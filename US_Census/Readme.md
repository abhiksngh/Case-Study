US Census People Analytics Case Study


Task: Creating a machine learning model to predict whether an individual’s income is >50K or <=50K per year from the census data. 


Business Problem (Assumption): I have assumed that this data is to be used by a startup credit lending company and they want 
to classify individuals into low risk and high risk categories for credit card approval. My main aim with the final model 
would be to reduce misclassification rate of individuals who have earnings ‘<=50K’ into ‘>50K’
